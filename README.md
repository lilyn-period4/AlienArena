Game: MULTIPLAYER
pac-man maze thing
Used to play pac man a lot, one of my fav games
^

ga

me based off that
-lots of twists and turns
-3 chests, one fake, one real, one bad thing per level
-ghost can only go one route at certain speed
-2 or 3 levels

depending on time and skill
-if run into ghost die instantly, GAME OVER on screen, back to start of level
-3 ghosts, one per chest
-some dead ends
-use arrow keys to control player
-get to third chest at end of maze to get to next level
-get third chest in final level of game
-people will be playing the ghosts while you play you
-each totem collected sends back to starting point and /tp’s the totem into the final totem chest





Story,
Three totems have been misplaced in multiple chests, you are an explorer who has realized that this has been affecting things around the world. You go to the temple to try to find each chest and put all the totems back in the main chest at the back of the temple. The reason this was not accomplished sooner is because the wizard who misplaced this totem created three protectors, also known as haunters, that will roam only a certain part of the temple around each totem chest, but they only move at a certain speed and route. The other trap that has been placed is that one chest is a fake so it will be completely empty and you must get out of the hall before the haunters catch you. There are two levels of the tempe and each floor has a final totem collection. To stop the world from falling apart you embark on this quest staring… NOW!




Setting,
Ancient temple in middle of ocean




Character,
Option 1, one player: hopeful, friendly explorer who just wants to help people get back to their original life and save the world objective is to get all totems in each chest and complete both levels. Must avoid the haunters to get to the chest
Option 2, three players: Haunter, objective is to keep explorer from getting all the totems into the final totem chests. You must tap on them in the game, and that will send them back to the start of the level with an empty inventory. You are only able to travel so far without needing to recharge by a certain chest which limits your travel. Very sad and lonely, you only want the explorer to be your friend:( Very proud of your job though and will not let them steal from you.
